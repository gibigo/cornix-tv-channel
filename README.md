Tradingview forwarder optimized for cornix.

## üí° About
This project is a highly customizable webhook server which is optimized to use with cornix. It has an API where you can set up different channels and set a strategy for the entry, take-profit, and stoploss price.

## üöÄ Getting started

### ‚ö°Ô∏è Requirements
In order to use ctvc (cornix-tv-channel) you need 
- a server (preferably linux)
- public IP  
- either port 80 or 443 available

### üì± Prerequisites
- create a telegram bot, see [here](https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather)

## üßë‚Äçüíª Deployment 
### üê≥ Docker
Docker can be used for quick and easy deployment. 

To install `docker` and `docker-compose`, take a look at [this](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [this](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

**Create the docker-compose.yml file**
```yml
---
version: '3.7'
services:
  ctvc:
    image: jon4hz/cornix-tv-channel
    restart: unless-stopped
    hostname: ctvc
    container_name: ctvc
    volumes:
        - ./data:/data
    environment:
        TELEGRAM_TOKEN: 110201543:AAHdqTcvCH1vGWJxfSeofSAs0K5PALDsaw # you telegram bot token
        REGISTRATION: true # enables user registration
        LOG_LEVEL: info # set the log level, (debug,info,warn)
        DATABASE_DEBUG: false # enable debug mode for the database
```

**Excute the service**   
`docker-compose up -d`

**Stop the service**  
`docker-compose down`

### üì¶ Use binary
Every github release has binaries attached for the following operating systems:
- Linux
- MacOS

To run ctvc as a binary follow those steps:
1. Download the [release](https://github.com/gibigo/cornix-tv-channel/releases) for your system and unzip the executable
2. Place it in a folder where you can run it. A subfolder is created for the database
3. Set either the required [enviroinment variables](https://github.com/gibigo/cornix-tv-channel) or write a [config fil](https://github.com/gibigo/cornix-tv-channel)
4. Run the executable

### üë©‚Äçüíª Build locally 
Since the code is fully open source, you can also build the binary yourself.  

As a prerequisite, please configure your go development environment and enable go modules. 

1. Clone the repository  
`git clone https://github.com/gibigo/cornix-tv-channel`
2. Change direcory  
`cd cornix-tv-channel`
3. Download all go modules  
`go mod download`
4. Build the binary  
`go build .`
5. Set either the required [enviroinment variables](https://github.com/gibigo/cornix-tv-channel) or write a [config file](https://github.com/gibigo/cornix-tv-channel)
6. Run the binary  
`./cornix-tv-channel`
